#Fillit@42
Can you feel it?

##Introduction

Fillit is a project that let you discover and/or familiarize yourself with a recurring
problematic in programming: searching the optimal solution among a huge set of possibilities, in a respectable timing. In this particular project, you will have to find a way to
assemble a given Tetriminos set altogether in the smallest possible square.
A Tetriminos is a 4-blocks geometric figure you probably already heard of, thanks to
the popular game Tetris.
